# EMDR Clicker

Simple web tool that provides stereo clicks for
[EMDR Therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_desensitization_and_reprocessing).

Hosted on Firebase, but this generates static HTML / JS / CSS so it can be
hosted anywhere, even locally.

**WIP**

## Local Development

Build:
```shell
npm run build
```

Clean up generated files from build:
```shell
npm run clean
```

Watch for changes and rebuild dynamically:
```shell
npm run watch
```

Run local webserver that serves builds:
```shell
npm run serve
```
